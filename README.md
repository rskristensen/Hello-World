ABOUT ME

Other than some BASIC programming on C64 I'm fairly new to coding.

I come from a technical background. I've repaired home appliances for eight years, but also worked with with remote camera work, inspecting welds in nuclear reactors.

My goal with coding is to eventually become a work from home contractor, to allow me to spend more time with my family in a way that was incompatible with the nuclear industry.
